# CleaningDataProject
Final Project for Coursera'a Cleaning Data Course

The 3 R Scipts included are run_analysis.R, FinalDataSet.txt, and the CodeBook.md.

The run_analysis.R is the R script that I used to modify the data by 
1. Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The FinalDataSet.txt is the data that resulted after the above transofmations on the dataset. 

The CodeBook is a description of how I tidied the data, as well as the variables I used in my run_analysis.
